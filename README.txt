This video game is called Alablaster, a game made for a group project in the Spring semester of 2023. 

My role was doing everything except the textures for models and the music. I was doing modeling, coding, level design, and UV mapping the models in Blender.

Alablaster is a project made in the Godot game engine which uses the programming language of GDScript. GDScript is a language quite similar to C#. This game was made in the 3.5 release of Godot.

In this game, you control a rolling ball that moves and hops around levels to collect 5 gems. Collect all 5 gems, reach the goal of the level, and try to beat your best times!
You will be bouncing across 4 distinct levels each with unique textures and music.	

Have a blast!
